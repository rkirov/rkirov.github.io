      <description>Incremental computation is a way of performing computations, with the expectation of future changes in inputs. When those changes occur the new output can be obtained efficiently, at minimum avoiding redoing the whole computation.
Many programming environments deal with this problem - UI programming, dataflow, build systems, etc. Despite its prevalence, I find it is rarely viewer as a unified computational paradigm, as opposed to ad-hoc application of caching. In comparison, other computational paradigms like concurrent or distributed computating have better established nomenclature and techniques.</description>
