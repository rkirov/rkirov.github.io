  <h1 id="leaning-on-ai">Leaning on AI</h1>
<p>It&rsquo;s been five months since my last dedicated <a href="../lean4">Lean post</a> and as usual I have started to lose steam on Lean projects. After the thrill of discovering the world of formalized mathematics started to wear off, I did not find motivation to push as hard as before. The SF Math with Lean work group kept me vaguely connected (at least in the one hour a week we meet <a href="../lean_workgroup">(see retro)</a>) but other than that I wasn&rsquo;t putting in more than a few hours a week on math and Lean.</p>
<p>So when I tried to get back into working through Tao&rsquo;s companion chapter 6, I had a rough awakening - while I remembered roughly my way around Lean tactics, I seem to have forgotten most of mathlib theorem names. Grinding through chapter 6 felt even harder and more chore-ish than before.</p>
<p>Luckily for me, the times have changed&hellip;</p>
<h2 id="claude-proof">Claude Proof</h2>
<p>It seems that AI tools reached a breaking point, where more and more engineers are using Claude Code daily for their coding tasks. As a manager I don&rsquo;t code as much at work, so I was slow to switch from the autocompletion use of AI (GitHub Copilot, which I used for last year&rsquo;s Advent of Code, for example) to the new fully agentic coding with AI.</p>
<p>But basically, I was faced with a hard choice - at my current pace, it would take me at least a year to complete Tao&rsquo;s companion text, and I have to commit to memory a large number of mathlib theorems - was it <code>lt_le_of_le</code> or <code>lt_of_le_lt</code>. Or I can take a plunge into using Claude Code for Lean more aggressively.</p>
<p>I decided to do the latter and the results were amazing.</p>
<h2 id="the-setup">The Setup</h2>
<p>Inspired by moltbot (which I briefly experimented with) I wanted to have a claude code instance that is continuously working - I got a VM from digital ocean, setup Claude code and all lean tooling, enabled Lean MCP server and let it grind. I even have an iOS terminal emulator to check on progress and discuss issues when stuck.</p>
<h2 id="results">Results</h2>
<p>Claude Code 4.6 is fully able to autonomously complete all examples and exercises in the real analysis companion <a href="https://github.com/rkirov/analysis/blob/main/analysis/Analysis/Section_6_4.lean">see section 6.4 for example</a>. I used two concurrent agents and upgraded to Claude Max (which was enough for them).</p>
<p>In one weekend I (we?) managed to complete sections 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, while I kept my usual weekend routine - bike ride, board games, watched the Super Bowl. I was maybe 2 hours max in front of the computer, to do code reviews and read the agents&rsquo; summaries. Without AI, this would have easily been 10x the time effort on my part, and given I know Lean basics, the educational value for me would have been questionable.</p>
<p>I also manually checked places where the agents spotted odd formulations in Lean, which turned out to be typos when I cross-referenced with the actual textbook. As it is the case with everything these days, there is nothing that I believe can&rsquo;t be done by AI on fundamental grounds, but some things are still more ergonomic for me to do. For example, if my agent opens an upstream request, I need to verify it is not sending Tao some nonsense and wasting his time. The agents do the work, we provide the value system.</p>
<p>I had to learn how to improve my prompt <a href="https://github.com/rkirov/analysis/blob/main/CLAUDE.md">see CLAUDE.md</a> and periodically ask the agents for key insights. I do read the PRs they produce and incorporate suggestions if I don&rsquo;t like the style or believe there is an easier way to do something.</p>
<h2 id="is-there-a-problem">Is there a problem?</h2>
<p>A nagging thought started to bother me. Using AI is undoubtedly more efficient, but am I defeating the point of the whole exercise? Why am I working through Tao&rsquo;s Real Analysis companion? I want to learn formalized mathematics with Lean, and by analogy with computer programming, the only way to learn a language is to write a lot of code in it. I don&rsquo;t do math research so the only math within my access is undergraduate and graduate textbooks. But if AI is writing the Lean code, what am I learning?</p>
<p>I broke it down further. Not all knowledge is equal, and AI help has very different costs for each kind:</p>
<p><strong>Basic language familiarity</strong> - key concepts, tactics. This I already got by manually working through chapters 2 to 5. It is an open question what I would recommend to a newcomer; following what I did doesn&rsquo;t seem efficient. I probably should have started using AI earlier, but it was also not as capable back then. My current bar: if a tactic appears in my codebase and I can&rsquo;t explain what it does and roughly when to reach for it, that&rsquo;s a gap worth closing.</p>
<p><strong>Knowing mathlib theorems and structures</strong> - this doesn&rsquo;t feel useful to learn as a human at all. I know <code>a &lt; b</code> and <code>b &lt;= c</code> implies <code>a &lt; c</code>, committing the mathlib theorem name to memory is not useful. This is pure search, and outsourcing search to AI is pure upside.</p>
<p><strong>Learning advanced proof engineering</strong> - (again by analogy with executable software) design patterns, good proof style, etc. This is indeed my next goal, but Tao&rsquo;s companion is not the right exercise for it. Someone already decided what the lemmas are, how they&rsquo;re organized, what depends on what. I&rsquo;m getting zero reps on the hardest part of proof engineering — decomposing a theorem into pieces that are individually provable and collectively sufficient. That requires a project where I&rsquo;m making the structural decisions myself.</p>
<p><strong>Engaging with the underlying mathematical ideas</strong> - this is the most important, non-negotiable thing. If Claude figures out the proof strategy and I read it afterwards, I&rsquo;m getting a fraction of the value compared to working through it myself. That said, a lot of the proofs in this intro real analysis textbook have no novel proof strategy - they are just expand the definitions and follow your nose, and only formalization with Lean makes them tedious.</p>
<h2 id="the-workflow">The workflow</h2>
<p>To make it more concrete, I am experimenting with the following protocol per chapter:</p>
<ol>
<li>Read the textbook chapter.</li>
<li>Read the corresponding .lean file and spot novel Lean concepts (at this point this is rare).</li>
<li>Look through the examples and see if there are novel math ideas (often none, there is a reason those are not exercises). Ask Claude to complete all examples.</li>
<li>Read through the exercises and sketch out a proof in Lean code or as a comment in Lean.</li>
<li>Ask AI to finish the proofs of the exercises.</li>
<li>Review Claude&rsquo;s summary (which I asked it to always produce after each session in CLAUDE.md).</li>
<li>Review the generated code. Unfamiliar tactic? Look it up. Unexpected proof strategy? Stop and understand why it worked.</li>
<li>If there is a repeated pattern, encode it as a rule in CLAUDE.md.</li>
<li>If there is something I don&rsquo;t understand, ask clarifying questions.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="the-claudemd-as-style-guide">The CLAUDE.md as style guide</h2>
<p>Step 8 deserves more attention, because it turned out to be surprisingly educational. The CLAUDE.md file is where I encode things like which tactics to prefer, when to ask me for help versus push through, what &ldquo;done&rdquo; looks like. Writing these instructions forces me to articulate my own standards. I can&rsquo;t tell Claude Code &ldquo;write clean proofs&rdquo; — I have to say what clean means. Prefer <code>exact</code> over <code>simp</code> when the term is short? Don&rsquo;t use <code>omega</code> to close goals that have mathematical content? Every rule I write is a proof engineering opinion I had to develop and make explicit.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s iterative. Claude does something I don&rsquo;t like, and instead of just fixing it, I ask whether this is a one-off or a pattern. If it&rsquo;s a pattern, it becomes a rule. Over time the CLAUDE.md becomes a document of my evolving Lean taste — a style guide for formalization that I authored through friction with the tool.</p>
<p>The irony is that this is one of the places where the AI workflow teaches me <em>more</em> about proof engineering than working alone would. Solo, my standards stay implicit. Having to communicate them to an agent forces clarity. And the resulting proofs end up more distinctly <em>mine</em> — shaped by my preferences, my aesthetic, my opinions about what good formalization looks like — than they would be if I were just following whatever path the tactics led me down.</p>
<h2 id="looking-forward">Looking forward</h2>
<p>This all feels novel and foreign to the old world of actually writing the code yourself. But five months of losing steam taught me that the perfect workflow I never use is worse than the imperfect one that keeps me going. And maybe there&rsquo;s another thing I&rsquo;m learning besides Lean — how to work with AI itself. That might end up being the most useful skill I take away from this whole project.</p>
